Documentation for dataset.npy and logdata.npy.
Both files have 30 columns, which contain the same data, except that logdata.npy is the log10 of dataset.npy.

Column 0:  kepid   (Kepler ID)
Column 1:  kepmag  (Kepler band magnitude)
Column 2:  teff    (effective temperature)
Column 3:  logg    (log10 or surface gravity)
Column 4:  radius  (radius in Solar radii)
Column 5:  range   (amplitude of light curve)
Column 6:  rmsmdv  (rms variation)
Column 7:  mdv3    (median differential variation in 3 hour bins)
Column 8:  mdv6    (mdv 6 hour bins)
Column 9:  mdv12   (mdv 12 hour bins)
Column 10: mdv24   (mdv 24 hour bins)
Column 11: mdv48   (mdv 48 hour bins)
Column 12: mdv4d   (mdv 4 day bins)
Column 13: mdv8d   (mdv 8 day bins)
Column 14: npk     (number of peaks *)
Column 15: maxpkht (height of the largest peak in the periodogram)
Column 16: maxper  (period of the largest peak)
Column 17: maxflx  (flux under the largest peak)
Column 18: sndht   (height of the second largest peak)
Column 19: sndper  (period of the second peak)
Column 20: sndflx  (flux under the second peak)
Column 21: np3d    (number of peaks with periods 3 days or less *)
Column 22: np9d    (number of peaks with periods 9 days or less *)
Column 23: nsigpks (number of significant peaks *)
Column 24: rms4    (rms deviation)
Column 25: cdpp3   (cdpp, a measure of "noisiness" in 3 hour bins)
Column 26: cdpp6   (cdpp 6 hour bins)
Column 27: cdpp12  (cdpp 12 hour bins)
Column 28: pdcvar  (a measure of variability)
Column 29: crowd   (the crowding of the source--a high value means less reliable photometry)
